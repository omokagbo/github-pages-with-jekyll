Hi, I am **omokagbo** :wink:, a software developer.
My interests are in front end development and iOS development.
I will be taking through a journey of how I got into software development and sharing some of the things I have learnt along the way.
From HTML, CSS and JavaScript to Swift. 
Sit tight and enjoy the ride.

I hope we become friends along the way and share knowledge along the journey. :+1:
